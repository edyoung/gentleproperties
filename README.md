# A gentle introduction to property-based testing with CSCheck

Property-based testing is a great way to improve the thoroughness and quality of your tests and your code. 
I think people should use it more! This repository provides an introduction which tries to explain: 
What is property-based testing? Why would I care? How do I do it in practice?

This uses C# and the [CsCheck](https://github.com/AnthonyLloyd/CsCheck) library. 

I assume you are familiar with unit testing, but not property-based testing.
